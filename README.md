# weatherdata
This set of files is part of a demo of data scraping and visualization for the North Florida Tableau User Group. Feel free to download the csv file, which is the daily weather report data we'll be visualizing.

The dashboards are embedded on Tableau Public and available at the link below for download as a twbx file.

The two .py files are python web crawlers that scrape historical weather data from wunderground.com. The shorter file runs in a few seconds and will pull a week of data for the city of Jacksonville. The longer file was used to create the large csv in this repository and will take quite a while to run.
